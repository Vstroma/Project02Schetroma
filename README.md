# Project02Schetroma
// Project 2 simulates a conveyor belt system that uses
//multi-threading. There are two types of parts, blue and 
//red that are added to their respective conveyors.
// While doing this, text is printed to the command line
// and two separate text files are created to simulate
// the process.


// During testing, there was a lot of experimenting with
// threads and how they worked. I did not have a significant
// amount of experience with threads previously, so the
// testing did not go smoothly. However, in the end, I
// believe it came out pretty well.
